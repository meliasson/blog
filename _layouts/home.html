          <li>
            <a href="https://me-puyo-puyo.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Puyo Puyo</a>; a nostalgic (and oh so futile) attempt at recreating the action that took place in the university's computer labs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://me-tetris.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Tetris</a>; most likely implemented solely because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alw5hs0chj0" target="_blank">this video clip</a>, which explains the constant lack of line pieces.
