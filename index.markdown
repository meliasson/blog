Hello and welcome to Mikael Eliasson's personal website. I am a software developer by day and a programmer by night. I am thinking that I got kind of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde thing going, but something like a nerd and someone even nerdier is probably closer to the truth.

Not much content here at the moment, but you can always give [my thoughts on null being returned from interfaces targeting collections]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-10-03-collections-are-we-still-returning-null %}) a read. Hint: I do not like it and I think we can do better. Easily.
